"""Clean-room reference runner for the HOPE 111-D deploy contract.

This package is authored from scratch against the public observation / action /
RacketCommand contract. It is NOT the vendor deploy runner and contains none of
the vendor's source, tuned constants, or gates. It exists to document the contract
executably and to run the exported policy against the shipped MuJoCo sim.

Public modules:
  joint_order      -- the 31-DOF Agibot A3 joint order
  observation      -- the 111-D observation builder
  action_adapter   -- the shared ActionAdapter (raw_action -> joint targets)
  racket_command   -- RacketCommand + command sources
  ros_command_source -- ROS 2 planner bridge (hope_msgs/RacketCommand -> source)
  lifecycle        -- ready -> swing -> follow-through -> recovery state machine
  onnx_policy      -- onnxruntime actor wrapper (obs[1,111] -> raw_action[1,31])
  sim_bridge       -- MuJoCo (default) and AimRT-process (seam) bridges
  config           -- runtime config loader
  runner           -- the 50 Hz control loop

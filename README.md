# HOPE: Hitch Open Ping-Pong Embodied AI Challenge

HOPE is an open platform for humanoid robot table tennis, developed by [Hitch Interactive](https://hitchinteractive.com) (Intelligent Racing Inc.) in collaboration with the [ROAR Platform](https://roar.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley. The challenge invites teams to deploy whole-body humanoid controllers that can rally a ping-pong ball against human opponents or other robots, using off-the-shelf humanoid hardware and an open-source perception and planning stack.

This repository contains the full HOPE stack for the Agibot A3: Isaac Lab training for a **unified forehand/backhand whole-body policy**, a **no-spin planner** (ROS 2), a **MuJoCo evaluator** with real ball physics, and an **A3 deploy reference runner** — plus the preserved HOPE **reference design documents**, the **challenge rulebooks**, and the Agibot-provided A3 starter materials under `agibot/`.

## How To Read This Repository

Start with this README, then follow [QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md](QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md).
The rest of the repository is organized into four layers:

| Layer | What to read or run | Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Required path | `QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md`, `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/scripts/prepare_a3_isaac_asset.py`, `agibot/URDF/A3T2.5-URDF-std-pingpang/`, `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/` | Prepare the A3 Isaac asset, train the unified forehand/backhand policy (`task=HOPEPingPong`), export `hope_pingpong.onnx`, and evaluate `success_rate`. |
| Stable public contracts | `A3_ASSETS.md`, `docs/interfaces/`, `docs/POLICY_INTERFACE.md`, `docs/PLANNER_INTERFACE.md` | Frame conventions, joint order, the 111-D observation / 31-D action policy IO, ROS topics, `RacketCommand`, and asset expectations that stay stable when you integrate your own code. |
| Deploy and simulation references | `a3_deploy/`, `agibot/` | The public deploy contract and clean-room reference runner (`a3_deploy/a3_deploy_example/`), the MuJoCo/AimRT simulation fork, and the Agibot-provided A3 materials (URDF variants, vendor deploy example). |
| Background material | `hope_ws/`, `mocap/`, root `HOPE_*_Reference_Setup.md`, `REFERENCE_DOCS.md`, `ROADMAP.md` | The ROS 2 mocap/planner workspace for arena integration, the mocap frame/topic docs, the preserved design documents, and current scope/direction. |

A fresh clone contains only tracked files. Generated Isaac assets, training logs,
checkpoints, exported `.onnx` files, and ROS build artifacts are git-ignored and
regenerated locally; Agibot-provided materials under `agibot/` are tracked.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Prepare the A3 Isaac asset (bundled racket-equipped URDF, from the repo root)
python3 hope_training/whole_body_tracking/scripts/prepare_a3_isaac_asset.py --force

# 2. Train the unified forehand/backhand policy (inside your Isaac Lab Python environment)
cd hope_training/whole_body_tracking
source setup_train_env.sh        # defines the `isaac_py` launcher for the Isaac Sim Python
python scripts/train.py task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo headless=true

# 3. Export the deployable actor -> <run>/exported/hope_pingpong.onnx
python scripts/export_onnx.py --checkpoint logs/rsl_rl/hope_pingpong/<run>/model_<iter>.pt

# 4. Evaluate (real MuJoCo ball, continuous rally) -> {"success_rate": <float>}
python scripts/mujoco_eval_onnx.py --onnx logs/rsl_rl/hope_pingpong/<run>/exported/hope_pingpong.onnx

# 5. Watch the deploy reference runner drive the robot in MuJoCo
cp logs/rsl_rl/hope_pingpong/<run>/exported/hope_pingpong.onnx ../../a3_deploy/a3_deploy_example/models/
cd ../../a3_deploy/a3_deploy_example
bash scripts/run_pingpong_sim.sh
```

To close the loop with the planner (ROS 2):

```bash
cd hope_ws && colcon build && source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch hope_bringup hope_bringup.launch.py use_fake_ball:=true   # mocap-free smoke test

# in another terminal (same ROS env sourced):
cd a3_deploy/a3_deploy_example/reference
python -m a3_deploy_onnx_ref_pingpong --planner --view --realtime
```

The bundled motion clips under `hope_training/motions/preprocessed/` are
**reference-only placeholders** — replace them with real forehand/backhand clips
([docs/REPLACE_MOTIONS.md](docs/REPLACE_MOTIONS.md)) before training a policy you
intend to deploy. See [QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md](QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md) for the full
install → train → export → evaluate → run loop, and
[docs/RUN_ON_AGIBOT.md](docs/RUN_ON_AGIBOT.md) for the deploy path.

## Preserved Reference Documents

| Document | Description | Version |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [Motion Capture System Reference Setup](mocap/HOPE_Motion_Capture_System_and_Coordinates_Reference_Setup.md) | OptiTrack/NatNet and Chingmu/VRPN ROS 2 arena configuration, coordinate frames, competition rigid bodies (`Ball`, `P1`, `P2`; `Table` for calibration only), humanoid `base_link` marker setup, and streaming pipelines | v0.7 |
| [7DOF Racket Model-based Planner Reference Setup](HOPE_7DOF_Racket_Model_based_Planner_Reference_Setup.md) | Ball state estimation, trajectory prediction, and racket target planning (Stages 1–3 of the HITTER framework), reimplemented in the HOPE canonical frame | v0.1 |
| [WBC Simulation Training Reference Setup](HOPE_WBC_Simulation_Training_Reference_Setup.md) | SMPL-X motion acquisition, GMR retargeting, BeyondMimic RL training pipeline for whole-body control (Stage 4), with dual-backend support for Isaac Lab and mjlab | v0.5 |

The three documents at the repository root each contain a **Section 0 prologue**
listing implementation differences from the original HITTER work (see
References); the mocap pair documents its differences inline. Where a preserved
document disagrees with the shipped code, the code and the `docs/` contracts win —
[REFERENCE_DOCS.md](REFERENCE_DOCS.md) is the index.

During competition the motion-capture stream carries the named rigid bodies `Ball`, `P1`, and
`P2` (`Ball` is always first in `/poses`; the default VRPN bringup aggregates only the ball); a
`Table` asset is used for calibration only and appears only in training-data recordings. The ball pose includes position `(x, y, z)` and quaternion orientation
`(qx, qy, qz, qw)`; pitch/yaw/roll are derived display values. The shipped planner currently
uses only the ball position, while the full pose is preserved for validation and future
spin-aware estimation.

> The diagram shows both supported source paths: **Chingmu/VRPN** uses
> `vrpn_mocap` + `pose_to_posearray` (the default `mocap_backend:=vrpn`),
> while **OptiTrack/Motive uses NatNet** through the vendored
> `motion_capture_tracking` driver plus `optitrack_mct_relay`
> (`mocap_backend:=optitrack`). Both feed the identical `/poses` contract, so
> everything below that hop is unchanged. See
> [docs/OPTITRACK.md](docs/OPTITRACK.md).

The same policy runner drives either the shipped MuJoCo simulation
(`a3_deploy/a3_deploy_example/scripts/run_pingpong_sim.sh`) or, via your own
licensed Agibot vendor deploy package, the real robot
([docs/RUN_ON_AGIBOT.md](docs/RUN_ON_AGIBOT.md)).

## Key Design Decisions

**Racket tracking is prohibited.** During competition the motion capture system streams the named rigid bodies `Ball`, `P1`, and `P2` — the ball and the two humanoid `base_link` bodies. The table is a calibrated static world origin (a `Table` asset is used during setup only and appears only in training-data recordings). The ball stream contains position `(x, y, z)` and orientation, represented in ROS 2 as a quaternion `(qx, qy, qz, qw)`. Pitch, yaw, and roll are derived views, not fields carried by `geometry_msgs/Pose`. No reflective markers may be placed on the racket, the robot's hand, or the wrist link. Each robot must infer its paddle's 6-DOF pose through forward kinematics from its own `base_link` + joint encoders. This is a deliberate competition constraint that tests autonomous paddle control through the robot's internal body model.

**Implementation scope.** The preserved reference documents include robot-specific integration examples; the code currently shipped in this repository implements the Agibot A3 (31 actuated DOF) path end to end: Isaac Lab training of one unified forehand/backhand policy (`HOPE-PingPong-AgibotA3-v0`), MuJoCo evaluation with real ball physics, and a clean-room deploy reference runner, alongside Agibot's own deploy example and MuJoCo/AimRT simulation reference.

**Open-source training stack.** The WBC training pipeline is built entirely on open-source code: [BeyondMimic](https://github.com/HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking) (MIT license), from which the `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/` extension derives, [GMR](https://github.com/YanjieZe/GMR) (MIT license) for SMPL-X to robot retargeting, and [GVHMR](https://github.com/zju3dv/GVHMR) for monocular video-to-SMPL-X extraction. The HITTER paper's trained weights are not released; all training starts from scratch, and the bundled motion clips are placeholders to be replaced with your own retargeted swings ([docs/REPLACE_MOTIONS.md](docs/REPLACE_MOTIONS.md)).

## Supported Robots

The table below reports current repository implementation coverage.

| Robot | DOF | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Agibot Expedition A3 | 31 actuated | Shipped end-to-end path: Isaac Lab training, ONNX export, MuJoCo evaluation, deploy reference runner, plus the Agibot vendor deploy example. |
| Unitree G1 | 29 | Discussed in the preserved reference design documents (`HOPE_*_Reference_Setup.md`) only; no shipped code path. |

## Coordinate Frame Convention

All contracts share a common world frame (ROS 2 REP 103):

- **Origin**: Near-side left corner of the table surface
- **X**: Toward opponent (along the 2.74 m table length)
- **Y**: Left (along the 1.525 m table width)
- **Z**: Up
- **Table surface height**: 0.76 m above floor

The motion-capture system must stream Z-up poses to match this convention (in
OptiTrack Motive: **Up Axis → Z**). See [docs/interfaces/frames.md](docs/interfaces/frames.md)
and [mocap/README.md](mocap/README.md).

## Prerequisites

Each piece has its own dependencies — install only what the step you are on needs:

- **Training / export**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim + Isaac Lab (with `rsl_rl`), Python 3.10, PyTorch, CUDA GPU
- **MuJoCo evaluation / reference runner**: `mujoco`, `onnxruntime`, `numpy` (no GPU needed)
- **Planner workspace**: ROS 2 Jazzy (`rclpy`), `numpy`, `pyyaml`
- **Real arena**: OptiTrack Motive streams **NatNet** through the vendored `motion_capture_tracking` driver and `optitrack_mct_relay` (`mocap_backend:=optitrack`; set Motive **Up Axis = Z** and see [docs/OPTITRACK.md](docs/OPTITRACK.md)). Chingmu CMTracker/MCServer streams **VRPN** through `vrpn_mocap` and `pose_to_posearray` (`mocap_backend:=vrpn`). In either case configure the named 6-DOF competition rigid bodies `Ball`, `P1`, and `P2`; `Table` is calibration-only and is not streamed during competition.
